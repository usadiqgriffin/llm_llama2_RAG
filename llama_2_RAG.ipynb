Chris 2/2 <USER> @Tesco That's a great idea, and I'm okay for a refund, it was only 50p. <SYSTEM> @240999 Hey there, I've just called the Park Road Extra store and have spoken with Martin, who is currently the Duty Manager on shift this morning. 1/4 @240999 Whilst on the phone to him today, he checked the shelves and confirmed that there are no longer any out of date bottles available on shelves; one must have slipped through the net for which he has apologised for. 2/4 @240999 We'd insist on offering you a refund, given the fact that one of the bottles was out of date, this is a mistake on our part, and one you shouldn't have to pay for. 3/4 @240999 If you were happy to provide the details requested by Chris, we can get this setup for you and ensure you aren't left out of pocket. Kind Regards - Rob 4/4\", 'original user side information': '{}', 'original system side information': '{}'}], 'prompt': ['']}\n",
